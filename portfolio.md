This is a demo post to show you how to write blog posts with markdown.  I strongly encourage you to [take 5 minutes to learn how to write in markdown](https://markdowntutorial.com/) - it'll teach you how to transform regular text into bold/italics/tables/etc.<br/>I also encourage you to look at the [code that created this post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll/master/_posts/2020-02-28-sample-markdown.md) to learn some more advanced tips about using markdown in Beautiful Jekyll.

**Here is some bold text**

## Airport Cooperative Research Project (ACRP) Design Challenge {#ACRP}
The Airport Cooperative Research Program is a national competition for university students and was a component of one of my classes in the Engineering Leadership Development minor program. The competition tasked students with improving one aspect of an airport terminal and operations in a thoughtful and well-researched way; everything was to be submitted in a final report for industry experts and judges.  

Our group decided to investigate an aspect of an airport that we could directly study and improve: the terminal experience for elderly passengers. Through family interviews, field research at a local airport, and copious research on the elderly population in America, we decided to create a Bluetooth-based device that directs passengers to bathrooms, food courts, gates, and other services. Because of our efforts, we were awarded 2nd Place nationally in the Airport Management and Planning category.

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
