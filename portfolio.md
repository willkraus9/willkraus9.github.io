## Airport Cooperative Research Project (ACRP) Design Challenge {#ACRP}
The Airport Cooperative Research Program is a national competition for university students and was a component of one of my classes in the Engineering Leadership Development minor program. The competition tasked students with improving one aspect of an airport terminal and operations in a thoughtful and well-researched way; everything was to be submitted in a final report for industry experts and judges.  

Our group decided to investigate an aspect of an airport that we could directly study and improve: the terminal experience for elderly passengers. Through family interviews, field research at a local airport, and copious research on the elderly population in America, we decided to create a Bluetooth-based device that directs passengers to bathrooms, food courts, gates, and other services. Because of our efforts, we were awarded 2nd Place nationally in the Airport Management and Planning category.

## THON Bot: 5 Foot Tall Dancing Humanoid Robot {#THON}
As a way to build advanced experiences for the Robotics Club, I created the THON Bot project. THON Bot is a 5 foot humanoid dancing robot that will interact with attendees for 48 hours continuously at THON  2025. This is one of the most complicated and rewarding robotics projects that I have experienced at Penn State University; there are electronics and controls problems that I would not have encountered as an undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering.

As the founder of the project, I divided the project into 3 teams: Hardware, Electronics, and Simulation/Control. On the Hardware team, I oversee a team of interdisciplinary undergraduate engineers that design, 3D print, and assemble the plastic and metal components of THON Bot.

In the future, THON Bot has a variety of uses outside of the THON dance marathon. The project has functions and hardware that would benefit Human-Robot Interaction research or answer ethical questions about the nature of robots in society.
